## Learning Resources  
I've used mostly MOOCs to update my software development skills.  I decided to start with getting a general foundation with VR by focusing on one game platform, the Unity game engine, specifically Unity3D.  Because I want to do more mobile VR, the community recommend Unity3D as suppose to Unreal Engine.  Another reason for selecting Unity is because online learning materials on Unity.
