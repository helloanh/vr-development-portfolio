The tumultuous struggles of the labor movement in the 1930s, with their sit-down strikes and impassioned speeches, ignited his interest in social issues, he once said. 

        He was a soft-spoken and reserved man with a wry sense of humor. He also was a staunch Democrat. He first came to Washington in 1961 to serve in President John F. Kennedy's administration as deputy administrator of the Housing and Home Financing Agency. By then, he was a well-known labor leader and longtime aide to United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther. 

        He served two years in the Kennedy administration and helped to shape the Omnibus Housing Act of 1961 and to lay the groundwork for the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. Source: Washington Post"></a-entity>

Ramage’s involvement in ecumenical circles also focused on community organizing and social justice, as Executive Director of the Center for Community Change in Washing­ton, D.C., and as President of the New World Foundation in New York City. He was also one of the key leaders in organizing the Parliament for the World’s Religions centennial meeting in Chicago in 1993 out of which came the organization by the same name.
