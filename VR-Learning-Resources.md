# VR Learning Resources  
These are all the materials I've encountered, in some cases, enrolled, to help me develop my skills as a VR/AR Developer.  You will notice most are MOOCs or short-termed projects.  Some are free while majority are paid.  I have also include my notes and feedback on the courses I'm currently learning or have already completed. By far Udacity is the most expensive, then Coursera, then Udemy.     

1. Udacity nanodegree on VR Foundations - Broken down into 3 courses, Intro to VR, Scenes and Objects, and VR Software Development  
2. Udacity nanodegree on Mobile VR 360 - I'm currently enrolling in this course. 
3. [Coursera course on Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development)  - multicourse track for deeper understanding of C#. I haven't signed up yet, but this sounds like a good continuation after the nanodegrees.
4. Lynda course on Virtual Reality Overview for Developers, by Michael House  - Only 1-2 hours of video and a great intro to see if you will enjoy VR field.  
5. [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)  - VR web framework using HTML.  Still relatively new, but it is browser-based.    
6. [Facebook React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/) - Resource.  Looks polished, but I haven't explored this yet.  
7. [Google Poly](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop/) - Google's asset library for VR development.  Has toolkit to link to Unreal and Unity game engine.  
8. [Udemy course - Complete C# Unity Developer 3D - by Rick Davidson](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse2/learn/v4/overview)  
9. [Udemy course - The complete ARKit Course - Build 11 Augmented Reality - by Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/ios-augmented-reality-the-complete-course-on-arkit/learn/v4/)  
10. [Udemy course - iOS 11 & Swift 4 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp - by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/ios11-app-development-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) She has a newer course for iOS 12 version.
