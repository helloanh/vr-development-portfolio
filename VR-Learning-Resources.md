# VR Learning Resources  
These are all the materials I've encountered, in some cases, enrolled, to help me develop my skills as a VR/AR Developer.  You will notice most are MOOCs or short-termed projects.  Some are free while majority are paid.  I have also include my notes and feedback on the courses I'm currently learning or have already completed.   

## Cost Analysis  
By far Udacity is the most expensive at a flat rate of 999.99 per nanodegree that spans about 4 months, follow by then Coursera with their monthly 30-40 dollars subscription, and finally by Udemy with courses on sale for 12-15 dollars.    

I say Udemy has the most value but requires more motivation, since it doesn't have the social structure like the other two who will place you in a cohort with other people in the same session.  I've taken online college credit courses before and these classes have the same quality of training and a much better cost.  Even a course at my graduate MS program costs 4x as much a a nanodegree, so that's why I decided to give it a try.    

## Courses  
1. Udacity nanodegree on VR Foundations - Broken down into 3 courses, Intro to VR, Scenes and Objects, and VR Software Development  
2. Udacity nanodegree on Mobile VR 360 - I'm currently enrolling in this course. 
3. [Coursera course on Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/game-development)  - multicourse track for deeper understanding of C#. I haven't signed up yet, but this sounds like a good continuation after the nanodegrees.
4. Lynda course on Virtual Reality Overview for Developers, by Michael House  - Only 1-2 hours of video and a great intro to see if you will enjoy VR field.  
5. [AFrame](https://aframe.io/)  - VR web framework using HTML.  Still relatively new, but it is browser-based.    
6. [Facebook React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/) - Resource.  Looks polished, but I haven't explored this yet.  
7. [Google Poly](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop/) - Google's asset library for VR development.  Has toolkit to link to Unreal and Unity game engine.
